# Star-Trekker
A space navigation tool and model for group MERN project at [Coding Dojo](https://www.codingdojo.com)

## About
Star-Trekker is our prized project for our full-stack MERN project. We've compiled a few libraries to help give a scope of this project:

In no particular order\
**Backend**:
- [Iron-Session](https://github.com/vvo/iron-session)
- [B-Crypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js)
- [Cookie-Parser](https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-parser)\

**Frontend**:
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [BootSwatch](https://bootswatch.com)
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios#example)

This project was about spreading our wings and testing our developer mindsets by incorporating new technologies, and seeing how well we can read and understand external documentation, and getting comfortable with using GitHub as a collarboration tool.

We hope you enjoy our 3D bubble chart, and while you're at it, why not see where you can go next?
